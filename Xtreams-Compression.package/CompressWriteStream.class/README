Compresses the bytes (0..255) being written using the ZLib deflate algorithm and writes the compressed content into the destination stream which has to accept bytes as well.

Note that the compression algorithm buffers the content being compressed, consequently the stream has to be closed in order to be sure that the entire compressed content was written into the destination stream.

Instance Variables
	zlib	<ZLibInterface> external interface to zlib
	input	<ByteArray> fixed-space input buffer shared with zlib
	output	<ByteArray> fixed-space output buffer shared with zlib
