Converts consumed elements into bytes of pre-configured (primitive) CType, e.g. float, long etc. The type of the written elements must match the CType, the underlying destination must be binary.

Instance Variables
	elementSize	<Integer> byte size of elements of the pre-configured CType
	cache	<InterpretedBytes> caches the bytes so that they can be bulk written
	cacheSize	<SmallInteger> how many elements (not bytes) do we want to cache
	operation	<BlockClosure> CType translation primitive used to write into the buffer
	contentsSpecies	<Class> collection type to use to hold collections of elements
