MessagePackMarshaler defines the binary format of the MessagePack protocol ( http://wiki.msgpack.org/display/MSGPACK/Format+specification ), which is a binary JSON. It can marshal simple objects, but not whole classes, just like JSON. It is considered to be a very fast marshaler because of its lightweight protocol. It cannot handle circular references.
